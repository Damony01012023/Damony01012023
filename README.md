- 👋 Hi, I’m @Damony01012023
- 👀 I’m interested in not reinventing the wheel but making connections and build with the readily available resources. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning chatgpt and dall-e
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that enables machine learning commercialization 
- 📫 no. just no. not yet. 


algos are useless unless they trick down and *benefit* everyone's life. always happy to weave the threads together and open the baby up for interpretation. 

i am decently good at understanding requirements and translate them into actionable deploy ready code. looking to get further along with the actual deployment (containers!) or a reasonable orchestrator.
